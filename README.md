## Instructions

To start the matching game (i.e. "Memory"), simply click a card to turn it over. This will start the game timer and start counting the moves you make until the game is over.

You can restart the game at anytime by clicking the reset button.

## Contributing

This respository is for my version of the Memory Game for my second project in Udacity's Front-End Developed Nanodegree program, so I will most likely not accept pull requests.

For details on contributing to Udacity's original project (i.e. the starter code), check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
